I recently used some Sonoff S31 smart switches to automate my dust collection system. When I turn on a tool, my dust collector also turns on. I also built some automatic blast gates to control the flow of air. You can watch the full build video here https://youtu.be/KPoIxaH8A7w.

Bill of Materials:
1x Sonoff S31 smart switch for dust collector or shop vac
1x Sonoff S31 for each tool or power strip you want to monitor
1x 3D printed blast gate parts for each tool or zone you want to control. 
1x ESP8266 microcontroller (I used the Wemos D1 mini) for each blast gate
1x MG995 Servo for each blast gate
1x USB power supply and cable for each blast gate
